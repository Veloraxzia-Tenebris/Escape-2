# Escape-2
Modded version of escape.
You can now jump (normally) and actually push things. Instead of grabbing, try surfing the table over to the spotlight.
Fixed door colision issue: Now you can't just walk through it.
If you don't want to push things around, you can just push the door.

Used Unreal Engine C++ course from Udemy.
