# Escape-2
Modded version of escape.

When Unreal rebuilds things, it also replaces the modified door with its default door. Drag everything in _Fix into the main folder to fix this issue.

You can now jump (normally) and actually push things. Instead of grabbing, try surfing the table over to the spotlight.
Fixed door collision issue: Now you can't just walk through it.
If you don't want to push things around, you can just push the door.

Used Unreal Engine C++ course from Udemy.
